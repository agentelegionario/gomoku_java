GOMOKU 2D Game
==============

Inspired by a series of screen casts from Uncle Bob, where he builds a Gomoku game using Swift, 
  I found it cool and decided to give it a go in Java. 

To run the game, just execute the com.codurance.Gomoku class.

Note: Gomoku is also called Gobang or Five in a Row and the rules I followed can be found [here][1],
